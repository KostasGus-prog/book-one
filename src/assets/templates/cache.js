For living organisms, it is the cell; for skyscrapers, it is the steel I-beam; for modern electronics, it is the transistor. For popular music, it is a set of seven notes called the major scale. </p>");
$templateCache.put("templates/book/1.1.html"," <p>The major scale is just a group of notes that follow a special pattern - one that humans happen to really love. In fact, we love these notes so much that the vast majority of the songs you hear on the radio are built using just these seven notes played in a unique sequence. Doesn’t that seem remarkable? </p> <p>One set of these notes corresponds to the white keys on the piano. To hear them, click the play button. </p> <h4>The Major Scale</h4> <theorytab video-path=1/1/C-Major-Scale tab-id=3078 url-vars=\"showChords=false&showMelody=false&sPK=3078&bShowToolKit=true&bBookMode=true&measuresInSegment=1&sHarmonyMelodySelectorDefaultValue=Melody&sFile=DNALive&bGrayInstrumentLabels=true&bClickToLoad=true&startPixY=90\"></theorytab>  <p> Before you criticize this particular ordering of notes as uninteresting and not very musical, know that listening to them in this order is the equivalent of looking at an I-beam sitting on a construction site. However, when re-ordered, these seven notes can create almost every song you know and love. In other words, the white keys of the piano are all you need. Let’s listen to a few: </p> <ol> <li>“Over The Rainbow” from the motion picture <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> (1939)</li> <li>“Basketcase” by Green Day (1994)</li> <li>“A Whole New World” from the motion picture <i>Aladdin</i> (1992)</li> <li>“Hey Jude” by The Beatles (1968)</li> <li>“Blowin’ In The Wind” by Bob Dylan (1963)</li> <li>“Bad Romance” by Lady Gaga (2009)</li> </ol> <h4>Medley With the Major Scale</h4>  <theorytab video-path=1.1-medley-in-c-major tab-id=4542 url-vars=\"sPK=4542&bShowToolKit=true&showChords=false&showMelody=false&bGrayInstrumentLabels=true&bShowInstrumentOnStart=true&bRelativeNotation=false&sHarmonyMelodySelectorDefaultValue=Melody&bClickToLoad=true&soundTrackPad=0&startPixY=90\"></theorytab> <p> To be clear, there is nothing special about these specific songs that makes this possible; they were chosen simply because they are iconic and recognizable. </p> <h3>The Many Major Scales</h3> <p> The first note in the scale we just showed you happened to be C, but a major scale can actually be played starting from any note on the piano. Other major scales make use of the black keys, but they all sound basically the same, and any one of them can play all the songs you just heard. </p> <p> The fact that a major scale can start on any note is the reason songs are said to be written in a “key” like C or F or G - the key indicates the starting note of the scale that the song uses. For example, every song in the medley you just heard used the notes from the C major scale (since the starting note of the scale was C), so they are said to be played in the key of C. The original recordings of these songs don’t all use this particular major scale, but I bet you couldn’t tell and didn’t care; you still heard each song just as you remembered it. </p> <p> The fact that a major scale can start on any note is convenient for singers because it allows them to sing songs in the key that is most comfortable for their vocal range, but it makes trying to understand music a real mess. Consider two frequently used major scales: C major and D major: </p> <h4>C Major Scale</h4> <img src=img/c-major-scale-gray-labels.png> <h4>D Major Scale</h4> <img src=img/d-major-scale-gray-labels.png>  <p> Notice that the note D shows up in both scales. The note D, however, is in a different position in each scale: it’s the second note in the C major scale and the first note in the D major scale. </p> <p> This is important because the way a note is used in a song is determined by its position in the scale rather than its letter name. D plays a completely different role in a song written in C major than a song written in D major. </p> <p> Trying to understand a song by looking at just the names of the notes it contains isn’t very useful because it ignores this fundamental fact. Fortunately, there is a simple solution that makes understanding the structure of a melody and comparing different songs straightforward. </p> ");
$templateCache.put("templates/book/1.2.html","<p>So far, you have learned that:</p> <p>1. the lettered names of the notes contained in a song are of no help for understanding what is going on unless they are considered in the context of the major scale that a song is using.</p> <p>2. the particular major scale that a song happens to use doesn’t matter. Most songs can be played entirely with the white keys of the piano (the C major scale), but they wouldn’t sound much different if they were played in some other major scale that makes use of a different set of notes.</p> <p>For these reasons, it’s easier and more intuitive to understand music by referring to notes in a song by their position in their scale (1-7) rather than their actual letter names (C, D, E, ..., for example). To introduce you to this notation, often called relative notation, consider the two major scales you saw before but now annotated with numbered labels and colors to emphasize each note’s position in the major scale. </p> <h4>C Major Scale</h4> <img src=img/c-major-scale-on-piano-colored-labeled.png> <h4>D Major Scale</h4> <img src=img/d-major-scale-on-piano-colored-labeled.png> <p> When notes are referred to by their position in a scale, they are referred to as scale degrees. The note D, for example, is scale degree 2 of the C major scale since it is the second note of the C major scale, but it’s scale degree 1 of the D major scale. </p> <p> One of the most useful things about relative notation is that it enables songs that use scales with different starting notes to be compared side-by-side. For instance, one can compare a sequence of scale degrees rather than two different sets of lettered notes. </p> <h3>Visualizing Music Relatively</h3> <p> Since relative notation makes it easier to learn music, we created a simple way to display music in relative notation. The next example shows the C major scale displayed in relative notation on a staff. Each colored rectangle corresponds to a note. The vertical position indicates its scale degree (1, 2, 3, etc.) instead of its note name (C, D, E, etc). Color is used as an additional visual indicator of each scale degree. Red, for example, is always scale degree 1 regardless of the scale a song is using. Green corresponds to scale degree 4. The length of each note indicates its duration. When you click play, you will hear the scale degrees of the C major scale: </p> <h4>C Major Scale on Relative Staff</h4>  <theorytab video-path=1/2/C-Major-Scale-With-Staff tab-id=3078 url-vars=\"sPK=3078&showChords=false&bRelativeNotation=true&bShowInstrumentOnStart=true&bBookMode=true&measuresInSegment=1&bShowToolKit=true&sHarmonyMelodySelectorDefaultValue=Melody&bClickToLoad=true&nToolKitInstrumentYPad=-10\"></theorytab> <p> The next example shows the G major scale on the relative staff. Notice that even though the C major scale and the G major scale are different on the piano, they look identical on the relative staff since both use the exact same scale degrees as they play (1-2-3-4-5-6-7-1). </p> <h4>G Major Scale on Relative Staff</h4>  <theorytab video-path=1/2/G-Major-Scale-With-Staff tab-id=4615 url-vars=\"showChords=false&bRelativeNotation=true&bShowInstrumentOnStart=true&bBookMode=true&measuresInSegment=1&bShowToolKit=true&sHarmonyMelodySelectorDefaultValue=Melody&sFile=DNALive&bClickToLoad=true&nToolKitInstrumentYPad=-10\"></theorytab> <p> In the previous examples, the fourth scale degree of the C major scale happens to be F. In the G major scale, it happens to be C. In the relative system, however, both notes are represented by a green scale degree 4 to emphasize their sameness. </p> <h3> Real Songs in Relative Notation </h3> <p> A major scale is very simple, and you might be asking how this works with actual songs. Since most songs only use notes from the major scale, they can be represented naturally with relative notation regardless of the key they are written in. Below is the melody from the chorus of “Livin’ On A Prayer” by Bon Jovi visualized with the relative staff. </p> <h4>“Livin’ On A Prayer” by Bon Jovi</h4>  <theorytab video-path=1/2/Bon-Jovi-Melody-Only tab-id=4443 url-vars=\"showChords=false&bRelativeNotation=true&bShowInstrumentOnStart=false&sHarmonyMelodySelectorDefaultValue=Melody&bBookMode=true&enableYoutube=false&noEditEnableInstrumental=true&sFile=DNALive&bClickToLoad=true\"></theorytab> <h3> What Uniquely Identifies the Melody of a Song? </h3> <p> Thinking about melodies as numbers representing positions in a scale makes it much easier to compare different melodies at a glance. It also makes it easier to analyze and understand melodies because the position of the note in the scale is what determines function rather than the actual note name itself. </p> <p> The melody from “Livin’ On A Prayer” uses scale degrees 1-1-1-7-6-5-3-4-4-... in succession. If the song happened to use the C major scale, these scale degrees would correspond to the notes C-C-C-B-A-G-E-F-F, but it could just as well have been written in G major where these scale degrees would correspond to entirely different notes (G-G-G-F#-E-D-B-C-C). </p> <p> When we study the melodies and chords of different songs to look for patterns, we want to compare apples to apples, so the note names just won’t do. </p> ");
$templateCache.put("templates/book/1.3.html","<p> In the previous section you were introduced to the idea of understanding the notes in a song’s melody using a relative system. However, songs usually have many other notes being played besides the melody. These other notes work together to create rich sounds called chords. In this section we will extend the concept of relative notation to chords and learn how to break up a song into its two basic building blocks: its melody and its chords. </p> <p> Just as with the notes in the melody, the notes that form the chords of a song typically limit themselves to the same seven notes of whichever major scale the song happens to use. To give a specific example, there are lots of possible chords in music, but if a song is written in C, you are likely to find that it only uses chords that can be formed using the white keys of the piano. </p> <p> Because there are only seven notes in the major scale, there end up being only seven basic chords that can show up in a given song. Just as we did with melody, labeling these seven possible chords with numbers turns out to be very useful. The first of these chords is built off the first scale degree and for this reason is called the <i>I</i> (“one”) chord. </p> <div class=\"message info\"> Since we will now be using numbers to refer to both chords and notes, to avoid confusion, we will use italicized Roman numerals when referring to chords. </div> <p> In addition to using scale degree 1, the <i>I</i> chord also contains the scale degrees 3, and 5. In the key of C, this corresponds to the notes C, E, and G and creates a C major chord. Let’s listen to scale degrees 1, 3, and 5 of the C major scale. First we will play each scale degree individually, then we will play scale degrees 1, 3, and 5 (notes C, E, and G) at the same time to create a <i>I</i> chord. </p> <h4>Formation of a <i>I</i> Chord</h4>  <theorytab video-path=1/3/I-Chord-Triad tab-id=4548 url-vars=\"sPK=4548&showChords=false&bRelativeNotation=true&bShowInstrumentOnStart=true&bBookMode=true&bShowToolKit=true&nToolKitInstrumentYPad=-10&sHarmonyMelodySelectorDefaultValue=Melody&bClickToLoad=true\"></theorytab> <p> Now you may be thinking that a simple chord like this with only three notes couldn’t possibly be very useful. After all, songs certainly aren’t limited to playing just three notes at once! </p> <p> It turns out the <i>I</i> chord need not be played with scale degrees 1, 3, and 5 arranged exactly as we just showed you; as long as scale degree 1 is the lowest note, you can reorder the other scale degrees and play any of them more than once. The next example shows a few variations of scale degrees 1, 3, and 5 that also form <i>I</i> chords. </p> <h4>Variations of a <i>I</i> Chord</h4>  <theorytab video-path=1/3/I-Chord-Triad-Expanded tab-id=4562 url-vars=\"showChords=false&bRelativeNotation=true&bShowInstrumentOnStart=true&bBookMode=true&bShowToolKit=true&sHarmonyMelodySelectorDefaultValue=Melody&bClickToLoad=true&nToolKitInstrumentYPad=-10\"></theorytab> <p> This means that even if it looks like a chord has a lot of notes in it, it’s often likely still just playing three distinct scale degrees corresponding to one of the basic chords. </p> <p> We’ve been showing you a lot of pianos, but this all works the same way regardless of instrument. If you put your fingers on the following frets of a guitar and strum, the strings will play the labeled notes, also resulting in a <i>I</i> chord in the key of C: </p> <img src=img/c-major-on-guitar.png> <p> Note that even though five strings are played, only three distinct scale degrees are involved: 1, 3, and 5 of the C major scale. Scale degrees 1 and 3 (red, and yellow) are repeated twice. The majority of standard chords on guitar play all six strings yet only involve three distinct notes. </p> <h3> The <i>ii</i> Chord </h3> <p> The other six basic chords are built just like the <i>I</i> chord. The <i>ii</i> chord (“two” chord) is built from scale degree 2 of the major scale and contains scale degrees 2, 4, and 6. Let’s listen to scale degrees 2, 4, and 6 of a major scale starting on the note C. First we will play each scale degree individually, then we will play scale degrees 2, 4, and 6 at the same time to create a <i>ii</i> chord. </p> <h4>Formation of a <i>ii</i> Chord</h4> <theorytab video-path=1/3/ii-Chord-Triad tab-id=4549 url-vars=\"showChords=false&bRelativeNotation=true&bShowInstrumentOnStart=true&bBookMode=true&bShowToolKit=true&sHarmonyMelodySelectorDefaultValue=Melody&bClickToLoad=true&nToolKitInstrumentYPad=-10\"></theorytab> <p> In the key of C, the <i>ii</i> chord corresponds to a D minor chord. Minor chords have a different sound than major chords (the <i>I</i> chord you heard before is a major chord). The reason for this turns out to be a difference in the relative spacing between the scale degrees that make up the chords. In the next graphic, we illustrate this on the piano by counting the notes between scale degrees 1 and 3 in the key of C (notes C and E), and comparing it to the number of notes between scale degrees 2 and 4 in the key of C (notes D and F). This spacing difference between the scale degrees that make up each chord causes the chords to have a different sound. </p> <h4>Major Quality, e.g. <i>I</i></h4> <img src=img/quality-major-I.jpg> <h4>Minor Quality, e.g. <i>ii</i></h4> <img src=img/quality-minor-ii.jpg>  <p> When people compare the sounds of major and minor chords, they often say minor chords sound more dissonant and “somber”, while major chords are more “bright” sounding. </p> <p> To make it immediately obvious whether a chord has a minor quality or a major quality, we use upper case Roman numerals for major chords and lower case Roman numerals for minor chords. This means that we’ll always refer to the second chord as a <i>ii</i> chord (not a <i>II</i> chord) because it is minor. </p>  <h3> “Block” Representation for Chords </h3> <p> Since it would be inconvenient to always show the individual scale degrees that make up a chord, we’ll often use a simple “block” representation for chords, as shown below. </p>  <h4>Block Representation of Chords</h4> <theorytab video-path=1/3/Block-Notation tab-id=4564 url-vars=\"bBookMode=true&sRhythmAlgorithm=display&bClickToLoad=true&nToolKitInstrumentYPad=-10\"></theorytab> <p> The color of the block reminds you of the scale degree that the chord is built on. For example, <i>I</i> chords are built off the first scale degree so they have a red block. In addition, the Roman numeral name of the chord is inside the box. Notice that the <i>ii</i> chord block, for example, is the same for two different arrangements of scale degrees 2, 4, and 6. That is because any combination of scale degrees 2, 4, and 6 create a <i>ii</i> chord as long as scale degree 2 is the lowest note. </p> <h3> The Other Basic Chords </h3> <p> The other five basic chords are built just like the <i>I</i> and <i>ii</i> chords so it’s not necessary to go through each one individually. The next example shows the scale degrees that make up each of the seven basic chords and the Roman numeral “block” notation for each chord. </p> <h4>Scale Degrees of Basic Chords</h4> <theorytab video-path=1/3/Key-Selector tab-id=4864 url-vars=\"sRhythmAlgorithm=NoChords&bRelativeNotation=true&bShowInstrumentOnStart=true&bShowToolKit=true&bShowKey=true&bShowSupportNameGraphicRel=true&sHarmonyMelodySelectorDefaultValue=Melody&nToolKitInstrumentYPad=-10\"></theorytab> <p> The <i>IV</i> chord, for example, contains scale degrees 4, 6, and 1; the <i>V</i> chord contains scale degrees 5, 7, and 2. Notice that of the seven possible basic chords, three have a major quality indicated by an upper-case Roman numeral (<i>I</i>, <i>IV</i>, and <i>V</i>), and three have a minor quality indicated by a lower-case Roman numeral (<i>ii</i>, <i>iii</i>, and <i>vi</i>). The last chord, <i>vii&deg;</i>, is neither major nor minor; its quality is called diminished (represented by lower case numeral with a degree sign next to it). The <i>vii&deg;</i> chord, however, is not as common in popular music so it will be treated later.</p>    <div ng-if=flashEnabled> <p> This example contains two new features: <ol class=ol-decimal> <li> Just below each chord block are chord names. For example, below the <i>I</i> chord, it says “<i>C</i>”; below the <i>ii</i> chord it says “<i>dm</i>”. These are the names of the chords (<i>I</i>, <i>ii</i>, <i>iii</i>, ...) when the major scale starts on the note C. Minor chords use lower-case letters, followed by a lower-case “m”. </li> <li> Next to the play button, there is a gray button with a red border that says “C Major”. This is the “key selector”. If you click on the key selector, you can change the scale to any other major scale. For example, if you select the A major scale, the chord names change to <i>A</i>, <i>bm</i>, <i>c#m</i>, <i>D</i>, ... and the notes on the piano shift so the scale starts on the note A. If you select the D major scale, the chord names change to <i>D</i>, <i>em</i>, <i>f#m</i>, <i>G</i>, ... and the notes on the piano shift so the scale starts on the note D. The key selector panel also has a pull-down for something called the “mode”; but we won’t cover modes until <i>Hooktheory II</i> (the sequel to this book). </li> </ol> </p> </div>  <div ng-if=!flashEnabled> <p> If you swipe through the images in the carousel below, you can see the names of the scale degrees (1, 2, 3, ...) and chords (<i>I</i>, <i>ii</i>, <i>iii</i>, ...) in each of the twelve keys. For example, if you swipe to the the A major scale (the second image in the carousel), the chord names change to <i>A, bm, c#m, D,</i> ... and the notes on the piano shift so the scale starts on the note A. If you swipe to the the D major scale (the sixth image in the carousel), the chord names change to <i>D, em, f#m, G,</i> ... and the notes on the piano shift so the scale starts on the note D. </p> </div> <div ng-if=!flashEnabled> <div ng-include src=\"\'templates/key-selector.html\'\"></div> </div>  ");
$templateCache.put("templates/book/1.4.html","<p> Songs are constructed by playing a series of chords one at a time in sequence. Sequences of chords are called chord progressions, and many of the later parts of this book will explore how chords within a chord progression are chosen to make a pleasing sound.  An example of a chord progression is shown below. Click play to hear how it sounds: </p> <h4><i>vi</i> &rarr; <i>IV</i> &rarr; <i>V</i> &rarr; <i>I</i> &rarr; <i>IV</i> &rarr; <i>V</i> Chord Progression</h4>  <theorytab video-path=1/4/Bon-Jovi-Chords-Hit-Once tab-id=4616 url-vars=\"bRelativeNotation=true&bShowInstrumentOnStart=false&sHarmonyMelodySelectorDefaultValue=Melody&bBookMode=true&enableYoutube=false&noEditEnableInstrumental=true&bClickToLoad=true&sFile=DNALive&sRhythmAlgorithm=display\"></theorytab> <p> To reinforce the connection between the block representation and the scale degrees it represents, the next example shows the implied arrangement of scale degrees on the relative staff.

The next example adds this melody to the chord progression you just heard.

Even though the example uses a generic arrangement for the chords, the chords and melody are immediately recognizable as “Livin’ On A Prayer” (assuming, of course, that you know the song). That’s because underneath all of the sparkle and shine, it’s the basic building blocks of a song that give it its overall character: its chords and melody. </p>  ");
$templateCache.put("templates/book/1.5.html","<p> To recap: most popular music can be reduced to just two basic building blocks: the melody, which can be represented by just seven different scale degrees played in some sequence; and the chords, which can be represented by just seven different Roman numerals played in some sequence. </p> <p> The goal of this book is to teach you the rules and structure behind chord progressions, melody, and their relationship to one another, so you can understand the how and the why behind it all and hopefully apply it to your own playing or songwriting endeavors. </p> <h3> A quick note about classical music </h3> <p> Before we begin, there’s one last thing you should know: while this discussion has been centered around “popular” music, know that much of classical music is governed by the same principles. If classical music is your thing, the topics we cover in this book will go a long way to helping you understand how classical music is structured as well. </p> <p> Below is a short passage playing the raw chords and melody from Mozart’s famous “Eine Kleine Nachtmusik” shown in relative notation. </p> <h4>“Eine Kleine Nachtmusik” by Mozart</h4> <theorytab video-path=1/5/Eine-Kleine tab-id=4456 url-vars=\"showChords=true&bRelativeNotation=true&bShowInstrumentOnStart=false&sHarmonyMelodySelectorDefaultValue=Melody&bBookMode=true&enableYoutube=false&noEditEnableInstrumental=true&sFile=DNALive\"></theorytab> <p> Even though Mozart was a master at arranging a room full of instruments to play many different notes in unison, it can all be broken down to the same simple melody and chord components that we’ve been talking about (in this case the entire ensemble has been reduced to just two chords: <i>I</i> and <i>V</i>!) </p>   ");

In this chapter, we will look at the function of some of the basic chords to see how they can fit in a chord progression. In particular, we’ll begin to answer the question, “if this chord were played next, would it sound good and why?”</p> ");
$templateCache.put("templates/book/2.1.html","<p>The first chord we’re going to learn about is the <i>I</i> chord, which is composed of scale degrees 1, 3, and 5 of the major scale. The <i>I</i> chord in our relative system is the chord that corresponds to the key of the song. For instance, if a song uses the G major scale, <i>I</i> is a <i>G</i> chord. If a song uses the C major scale, the <i>I</i> is a <i>C</i> chord.</p> <p><i>I</i> chords have a specific feel or sound to them that is consistent even between songs that are written in entirely different keys. This, remember, is the reason for abstracting out the actual key and referring to chords with Roman numerals in the first place.</p> <p>The function of the <i>I</i> chord in a song is to serve as a kind of “home base”. Some people say that <i>I</i> sounds comforting or safe, or that it creates a mood that feels familiar and reassuring. However, it’s somewhat difficult to describe in words exactly what it means to sound like “home base”, much like it would be difficult to explain to someone what a color looks like.</p> <h3>Learning the Sound of a <i>I</i> Chord</h3> <p>To get a feel for what the <i>I</i> chord sounds like, we will listen to a couple of chord progressions and try to identify when the <i>I</i> chord occurs. From now on, we will play examples with a simple rhythm so they sound more realistic. Listen to the following chord progression and try to hear which chords sound like “home base”. Aside from the first chord, there are two other <i>I</i> chords. </p> <h4>Identify the Location of the <i>I</i> Chords</h4> <theorytab video-path=2/1/Harmony-01-Journey tab-id=3328 url-vars=\"showAlternateCheckbox=true&bShowAlternates=true&noEditEnableInstrumental=true&noEditPlayMode=0\"></theorytab> <div ng-if=!flashEnabled>  <button class=\"button button-block button-positive button-outline\" ng-click=\"revealChords = !revealChords\"> Reveal the chords </button> <div ng-if=\"revealChords == true\"> <img src=img/2-1-Journey-Reveal.png> </div> </div> <p>If you haven’t already done so, you can click the “?” button to reveal the chord names.

It takes most people time to build up an ear for this kind of thing so don’t worry if you couldn’t pick the chords out.</p> <p>Let’s try the same exercise with a different chord progression.

$templateCache.put("templates/book/2.2.html","<p>Of the seven basic chords, certain chords are a lot more common than others. Because of its role as “home base”, the <i>I</i> chord shows up in almost every song, but it might surprise you that the <i>IV</i> and <i>V</i> chords are just as common.</p> <p>To visualize this, we used the songs in Hooktheory’s tab database to calculate the rates at which each of the basic chords shows up in popular music:</p>  <img src=img/Harmony-I-Chord-Popularity.svg> <p>As this chart shows, <i>IV</i> and <i>V</i> are really popular. The reason these chords are so common is that they play an important function in music; one almost as important as <i>I</i>\'s home base role.</p> <p>The primary function of <i>IV</i> and <i>V</i> is to complete and give closure to a chord progression and set up a smooth transition back to a <i>I</i> chord. This transition back to <i>I</i> is known in music as a cadence, and chords used to set up the cadence are called <b>cadence chords</b>.</p> <p>While it may not seem like we’ve told you much, you’ve actually already learned a great deal. You now know how to start and end a musical idea.</p> <h3>Basic Song Structure</h3> <p>The most common form of chord progressions is depicted in the figure below. The phrase starts on a <i>I</i>, does something else, then ends with a cadence chord indicated by the letter “C” to set up another phrase starting on <i>I</i>.</p> <img src=img/Harmony-I-Cadence.png> ￼ <p>Let’s listen to a couple songs that follow this basic structure. The first one we’ll look at is “Blowin’ In The Wind” by Bob Dylan:</p> <h4>“Blowin’ In The Wind” by Bob Dylan</h4> <theorytab video-path=2/2/Harmony-01-Dylan-Cadence tab-id=5181 url-vars=\"bShowAlternates=true&showMelody=false&noEditEnableInstrumental=true\"></theorytab> <p>Another example of a song following this structure is “I Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” by Aerosmith:</p> <h4>“I Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” by Aerosmith</h4> <theorytab video-path=2/2/Harmony-02-Aerosmith-Cadence tab-id=5180 url-vars=\"bShowAlternates=true&showMelody=false&noEditEnableInstrumental=true\"></theorytab> <div class=\"list card\"> <div class=\"item item-divider\"> Review </div> <div class=\"item item-text-wrap\"> What chord do chord progressions usually start on? <ol type=a> <li><i>IV</i></li> <li><i>V</i></li> <li><i>I</i></li> <li>It doesn’t matter</li> </ol> <button class=\"button center button-positive button-block button-outline\" ng-click=\"show1 = !show1\"> Show the answer </button> <div ng-if=\"show1 == true\" class=\"content message info\"> c. <i>I</i> </div> </div> </div> <p>One important feature of popular music, and something not as common in classical music, is the role of chord progression repetition. Often short chord progressions consisting of as few as three or four chords are played over and over again to create a groove. To link these repeating progressions together, a cadence chord allows the song to transition immediately to the beginning of the next progression. Check out the figure below to see what we mean:</p> <h4>Repeating Four-Chord Progression</h4> <img src=img/Harmony-I-Repetition.png> ￼ <p>Let’s listen to a real example of a song that follows this pattern - “Free Fallin’” by Tom Petty:</p> <h4>“Free Fallin’” by Tom Petty</h4> <theorytab video-path=2/2/Harmony-03-Petty-Repetition tab-id=5179 url-vars=\"bShowAlternates=true&showMelody=false&noEditEnableInstrumental=true\"></theorytab> <p>All of the songs shown so far have used the <i>V</i> chord to set up the end of the progression. <i>V</i> is generally a stronger cadence chord than <i>IV</i>. In longer phrases where the progression has been away from the <i>I</i> for a while, <i>V</i> is usually a better choice than <i>IV</i> to wrap things up because it reemphasizes the home base more forcefully. Using a <i>V</i> followed by a <i>I</i> is a great way to reorient the listener’s ear.</p> <p>That being said, the <i>IV</i> chord is also often used as a cadence chord. This is especially true in songs using short repeating chord progressions. “You Belong With Me” by Taylor Swift is an example of a song with a repeating chord progression that uses <i>IV</i> as a cadence chord.</p> <h4>“You Belong With Me” by Taylor Swift</h4> <theorytab video-path=2/2/Harmony-04-Swift-Repetition tab-id=5178 url-vars=\"bShowAlternates=true&showMelody=false&noEditEnableInstrumental=true\"></theorytab> <p>Of course, rules like this are meant to be broken, and we’ll see lots of examples that don’t follow this exact form.</p> <h3>Songs Using <i>I</i>, <i>IV</i>, and <i>V</i></h3> <p>In the previous section, we showed you the basic structure that chord progressions follow. A musical idea will usually begin on a <i>I</i>, and then do something before ending on a cadence chord. That “something” often involves the other chords we haven’t talked about yet. That’s not always the case, however. There are many famous songs that use exclusively these three chords. In fact, you just heard a few. Let’s take another look at “Blowin’ in the Wind” by Bob Dylan, this time with all of the chords revealed: </p> <h4>“Blowin’ in the Wind” by Bob Dylan</h4> <theorytab video-path=2/2/Harmony-05-Dylan tab-id=5173 url-vars=\"noEditMode=true&showMelody=false&noEditEnableInstrumental=true\"></theorytab> <p>Like the other examples you’ve seen so far, this progression starts on a <i>I</i> and ends on a strong <i>V</i> &rarr; <i>I</i>. In the middle, there is a lot of freedom to decide what to do with the other chords.</p> <p>Here are a few more examples that use a repeating chord progression structure. “Free Fallin’” by Tom Petty also uses a <i>V</i> chord to transition to the second repetition of the progression.</p> <h4>“Free Fallin’” by Tom Petty</h4> <theorytab video-path=2/2/Harmony-06-Tom tab-id=5177 url-vars=\"bShowAlternates=true&showMelody=false&noEditEnableInstrumental=true\"></theorytab> <p>“Push” by Matchbox 20 is another example of a song using a <i>V</i> chord as the cadence chord to end a repeating four chord progression.</p> <h4>“Push” by Matchbox 20</h4> <theorytab video-path=2/2/Harmony-07-Matchbox tab-id=5176 url-vars=\"bShowAlternates=true&showMelody=false&noEditEnableInstrumental=true\"></theorytab> <p>“The Lazy Song” by Bruno Mars uses another simple chord progression that uses <i>IV</i> as its cadence chord:</p> <h4>“The Lazy Song” by Bruno Mars</h4> <theorytab video-path=2/2/Harmony-08-Bruno-Mars tab-id=5174 url-vars=\"bShowAlternates=true&showMelody=false&noEditEnableInstrumental=true\"></theorytab> <h3>Staying Grounded in a Particular Key</h3> <p>If you’re new to the relative system, you might find it helpful to convert from Roman numbers to conventional chord names every once in a while to remind yourself what chords the Roman numerals represent.</p> <div ng-if=flashEnabled> <p> The following example will help you with this.

In the next section we’ll talk about the most common minor chord, the <i>vi</i>.</p> ");
$templateCache.put("templates/book/2.3.html","<p>While it is perfectly possible to write a song with only <i>I</i>, <i>IV</i>, and <i>V</i>, most songs do not limit themselves to these chords. One problem is that, as alluded to in Chapter 1, <i>I</i>, <i>IV</i>, and <i>V</i> are all major chords. This lack of variety means that the range of emotions that one can evoke is somewhat limited. One obvious way to make things more interesting is to include a minor chord in the mix, but which one to choose? Recall that the basic chords consist of the following:</p> <div ng-if=flashEnabled> <theorytab video-path=2/3/1-Key-Selector tab-id=4864 url-vars=\"sRhythmAlgorithm=NoChords&bRelativeNotation=true&bBookMode=true&nToolKitInstrumentYPad=0&bClickToLoad=true\"></theorytab> </div> <div ng-if=!flashEnabled> <div ng-include src=\"\'templates/key-selector.html\'\"></div> </div> <p>That means our choices for minor chords are <i>ii</i>, <i>iii</i>, and <i>vi</i>.</p> <p>While <i>ii</i> and <i>iii</i> are both minor chords that would fit the bill, <i>vi</i> is significantly more common. <i>vi</i> is very versatile and can be used in many situations without sounding awkward. It can be used after <i>I</i> and sounds great before or after <i>IV</i>, and <i>V</i>, for example. We’ll learn how <i>ii</i> and <i>iii</i> are used in Chapter 4.</p> <p>Let’s listen to the chords from “Don’t Stop Believing” by Journey to see how it incorporates the <i>vi</i>. Concentrate on the third chord (the <i>vi</i>) to get a feel for how <i>vi</i> sounds.</p> <h4>“Don’t Stop Believing” by Journey</h4> <theorytab video-path=2/3/2-Journey tab-id=3791 url-vars></theorytab> <p>This particular progression (<i>I</i> &rarr; <i>V</i> &rarr; <i>vi</i> &rarr; <i>IV</i>) is popular across many genres of popular music and shows up again and again. It has been used in so many songs that people have taken notice. Below are a few songs that have used this progression.</p> <h4><i>I</i> &rarr; <i>V</i> &rarr; <i>vi</i> &rarr; <i>IV</i> Medley</h4> <ol> <li>“Don’t Stop Believing” by Journey (1981)</li> <li>“Let It Be” by The Beatles (1970)</li> <li>“She Will Be Loved” by Maroon 5 (2002)</li> <li>“Edge Of Glory” by Lady Gaga (2011)</li> </ol> <theorytab video-path=2/3/3-1564 tab-id=4538 url-vars=\"showMelody=false\"></theorytab> <p>Keep in mind that these songs are not all in the same key and would seem to use different chords if you were to purchase their sheet music or guitar tab. Relative notation, however, makes it easy to see that they all use the same progression.</p> <p>Lastly, the message to take away from this video is not “all I need to be a pop star is this magical progression!” If your entire song only consisted of these four chords repeated over and over again in this order, it wouldn’t be very interesting. That’s why the songs from the previous example usually don’t rely exclusively on this progression. Other parts of the songs use different chords that complement the <i>I</i> &rarr; <i>V</i> &rarr; <i>vi</i> &rarr; <i>IV</i> so they don’t get old.</p> ");
$templateCache.put("templates/book/2.4.html","<p>Can one be creative with just the four chords that we’ve learned? It is reasonable to think that the answer might be no; after all, there’s not that many combinations that you can come up with, and it’s a good bet that a lot of the good ones have already been used.</p> <p>While things are certainly going to get a lot more interesting when we introduce more complex harmonies, you would be surprised at how much creativity just these four chords allow. One key to being creative is to have a coherent plan for how the different sections of your song will function. We’ll discuss a few of these techniques below.</p> <p>One way to be creative is to purposely omit a chord in one section of the song. In the verse, for example, you might omit the use of the <i>vi</i>, instead sticking to <i>I</i>, <i>IV</i> and <i>V</i>. This can create a sensation that something is missing, even though your listener may not be able to pinpoint what it is (that “missing” something being the minor sound of the <i>vi</i>). When the <i>vi</i> sounds in the chorus, it will fill that gap and make the progression more effective. As an example, let’s listen again to “Push” by Matchbox 20 for a little longer than we did before. The basic <i>I</i> &rarr; <i>V</i> &rarr; <i>IV</i> &rarr; <i>V</i> progressions lacks a <i>vi</i>, but when it finally sounds on the next line it really changes the tone of the song.</p> <h4>“Push” by Matchbox 20</h4> <theorytab video-path=2/4/1-Matchbox tab-id=4504 url-vars=\"showMelody=false\"></theorytab> <p>Another thing you you can try is to end several progressions in a row on the <i>IV</i> which has less pull to <i>I</i> than the <i>V</i>. Then, after getting the listener accustomed to this sound, you can suddenly switch to a more powerful progression ending on the <i>V</i>. The contrast will heighten the effectiveness of this cadence chord and make for a stronger progression. This technique is used by in the verse of “Love Story” by Taylor Swift, which uses several four-chord progressions of <i>I &rarr; IV &rarr; vi &rarr; IV</i> before swapping a <i>V</i> for the <i>IV</i> on the final time around.</p> <h4>“Love Story” by Taylor Swift</h4> <theorytab video-path=2.4-Taylor-Swift-Love-Story tab-id=260932 url-vars=\"showMelody=false\"></theorytab> <p>There are so many ways to be creative with your harmony, and experimenting is what makes songwriting so much fun. Another technique that is common is to experiment with progressions that start away from the home base of the <i>I</i> chord. This might be done in one section of the song, but then switch to something more conventional in the next to add variety. An example of a song that does this is “My Heart Will Go On” by Celine Dion. In the introduction the progression is <i>vi</i> &rarr; <i>V</i> &rarr; <i>IV</i> &rarr; <i>V</i></p> <h4>“My Heart Will Go On” by Celine Dion (Intro)</h4>  <theorytab video-path=2-2017-crf23-r100/2.4-Dion-Intro tab-id=335260 url-vars=\"showMelody=false\"></theorytab> <p>The <i>vi</i> &rarr; <i>V</i> &rarr; <i>IV</i> &rarr; <i>V</i> repeats twice and lacks the stable home base feel that the <i>I</i> chord provides. When the song switches to the verse starting on the <i>I</i> chord, there is a welcome contrast:</p> <h4>“My Heart Will Go On” by Celine Dion (Verse)</h4> <theorytab video-path=2/4/3-Celine-Verse tab-id=5455 url-vars=\"showMelody=false\"></theorytab> <p>By depriving the listener of the <i>I</i> chord for so long, when it finally does sound, the stable feeling associated with the <i>I</i> is magnified.</p> <p>The hope in presenting these examples is that you will realize that learning the function of chords will allow you to be more creative even if a progression you write has already been used by someone else. Writing a song with a coherent structure where one part is related harmonically to another is important. </p> <p>There is a lot more to learn, and we’re only just getting started. You have enough knowledge about chords to write a song that, while simple, is harmonically coherent. Before we move on and learn about more chords, we are going to switch gears for a bit to talk and talk about the basic structures of good melody.</p> ");

$templateCache.put("templates/book/3.2.html","<p>The melody of a  song exists within a rhythmic framework established by the other instruments. This framework, called the meter, gives songs a strong beat and sense of stability and continuity. The beat is what moves people with an innate sense of rhythm to tap their feet or dance without thinking.</p> <p>The basic rhythmic unit of a song is known as a measure. When listening to a song, we can usually identify when each measure begins because the first beat of each measure is often more pronounced. As you listen to “Wake Me Up” by Avicii, below, see if you can identify where each measure starts. After you’ve made your guess, click “Show Answer” to reveal the locations of the measures.</p> <h4>“Wake Me Up” by Avicii</h4>  <theorytab video-path=3/2/1-Avicii-No-Measures tab-id=33437 url-vars></theorytab>   <button class=\"button button-block button-positive button-outline\" ng-click=\"show1 = !show1\"> Show Answer </button> <div ng-if=\"show1 == true\">  <img src=img/Melody-Avicii-Measures.png> </div> <p>While listening to “Wake Me Up”, you may have noticed that some beats naturally felt stronger, and others weaker, depending on their location in time.

Listen to “Wake Me Up” again and see if you agree. </p> <p>In the next example, we count out the beats of a four-beat measure. This so-called “four-beat feel” is part of a class of meters called “simple” meter. Try and count along with us, giving emphasis to the strong beats (1 and 3) in each measure.</p> <h4>Simple Meter</h4> <theorytab video-path=3/2/2-Simple-Meter-Voice-Count tab-id url-vars></theorytab> <p>The four-beat feel is by far the most common meter in popular music. However, songs employ other rhythmic frameworks as well. The most common alternative has two primary beats, but each of these beats is further subdivided into three for a total of six beats per measure. Because each measure has two different types of subdivisions (two beats then three beats), this type of meter is referred to as compound meter (as opposed to simple meter). With six beats per measure, beats 1 and 4 are strong, where as beats 2, 3, 5, and 6 are weak. In the next video, we count out the six beats in a measure in compound meter. Try and count along, giving emphasis to the strong beats (1 and 4) in each measure.</p> <h4>Compound Meter</h4> <theorytab video-path=3/2/3-Compound-Meter-Voice-Count tab-id url-vars></theorytab>  <p>“Breakaway” by Kelly Clarkson is an example of a song that uses a compound meter.

$templateCache.put("templates/book/3.3.html"," <p>We just learned that a note’s position in a measure affects how much importance it has. Notes on strong beats are more prominent, notes on weak beats are less prominent. But that is only part of the story. Another factor that influences the melody are the notes contained in the chord being played at that time. Recall that when a chord is played, it is actually a combination of three scale degrees. For example, when a <i>V</i> chord is being played, the other instruments are playing scale degrees 5, 7 and 2.</p> <p>When a melody contains a note that is also part of the chord being played in the background or accompaniment, there is a sense of stability because the melody is reinforcing the harmony that is being used. Scale degrees in the melody that coincide with the underlying harmony are called <b>stable scale degrees</b>. Knowing the stable scale degrees of each chord is an extremely important tool for melody writing. For the first few examples in this chapter we will highlight the stable scale degrees in the melody staff above each chord.</p> <p><b>Unstable scale degrees</b> refer to the scale degrees that are not contained in the underlying harmony. For a <i>V</i> chord, these are 1, 3, 4, and 6. Similarly, when a <i>IV</i> chord is playing, the stable scale degrees are 4, 6, and 1.

While hanging around stable scale degrees adds security and stability to a melody, spending time on unstable scale degrees adds tension. Tension is a good thing in music, and writing a good melody involves properly balancing these two opposing forces. This balancing act shows up again and again in music, and we’ll come back to it frequently in this book. To demonstrate how the use of stable and unstable scale degrees affects the feel of a melody, consider the following examples.</p> <p>The melody in the chorus of “If We Hold On Together” (the theme from the motion picture <i>The Land Before Time</i>) is composed mainly of stable scale degrees. Using only stable scale degrees tends to create safe, pleasant, (but at times predictable) melodies. Depending on the context in which the music is meant to be heard (in this case, a happy scene from a children’s movie), this might be exactly what is desired.</p> <h4>“If We Hold On Together” by Diana Ross</h4> <theorytab video-path=3/3/01-Ross tab-id=189065 url-vars=\"bStableAlwaysOn=true\"></theorytab> <p>Unstable scale degrees on the other hand add dissonance since they are not contained in the accompanying chord. The right amount of dissonance can make wonderful melodies; too much dissonance, however can lead to disaster.</p> <div class=\"list card\"> <div class=\"item item-divider\"> Review </div> <div class=\"item item-text-wrap\"> From the perspective of stable vs. unstable scale degrees, which of the two melodies below would you expect to have more tension? <ol type=a>   <li><img src=img/3/3/ex-stable-vs-unstable-stable.png></li> <li><img src=img/3/3/ex-stable-vs-unstable-unstable.png></li> </ol> <button class=\"button button-block button-positive button-outline\" ng-click=\"show2 = !show2\"> Show Answer </button> <div ng-if=\"show2 == true\" class=\"content message info\"> b. Melody “a” should be more consonant because all of the scale degrees are stable in the harmony. Melody “b” is made exclusively of unstable scale degrees and will thus have more tension. </div> </div> </div> <p>Let’s listen to the two melodies below:</p> <h4>Melody A (Stable Scale Degrees)</h4> <theorytab video-path=3/3/Melody-Stable-02-Consonant tab-id=4531 url-vars=\"bStableAlwaysOn=true\"></theorytab> <h4>Melody B (Unstable Scale Degrees)</h4> <theorytab video-path=3/3/Melody-Stable-03-Dissonant tab-id=4530 url-vars=\"bStableAlwaysOn=true\"></theorytab> <p>Just because the unstable scale degrees in the second melody sound particularly toxic should not scare you away from using them entirely. The vast majority of melodies contain a combination of stable and unstable scale degrees. The melody from “Home” by Daughtry is one example of a song that balances stable and unstable scale degrees:</p> <h4>“Home” by Daughtry</h4> <theorytab video-path=3/3/Melody-Stable-04-Daughtry tab-id=189066 url-vars=\"bStableAlwaysOn=true\"></theorytab> <p>The amount of tension that an unstable scale degree contributes to a melody is dependent upon several factors. For instance, the location of an unstable scale degree in a measure (i.e. the beat that it falls on) will greatly enhance or reduce the extent to which it feels unstable.</p> <p>In general, unstable scale degrees in the melody do not contribute much tension to the song if they are played on weak beats. When unstable notes are used on weak beats to link two stable scale degrees together they are called <b>passing notes</b>. Notice that even the very stable “If We Hold On Together” example contains a passing note in the last measure. Using passing notes is a good way to give some life to your melody without adding the tension that comes with an unstable scale degree on a strong beat. Listen below to Melody A from the previous example, except this time adjacent stable scale degrees are connected using passing notes.</p> <h4>Melody A (With Passing Notes)</h4> <theorytab video-path=3/3/Melody-Stable-05-Consonant-Passing tab-id=4540 url-vars=\"bStableAlwaysOn=true\"></theorytab> <p>Notice that passing notes, although technically unstable, do not contribute much instability to the melody since they’re not on strong beats.</p> <p>To hear how a melody sounds with unstable scale degrees on strong beats, listen to “Sun and Moon”, the famous ballad from the musical <i>Miss Saigon</i>:</p> <h4>“Sun And Moon” from the musical <i>Miss Saigon</i></h4> <theorytab video-path=3/3/Melody-Stable-07-Sun tab-id=4539 url-vars=\"bStableAlwaysOn=true\"></theorytab> <p>Here the melody generates a lot of tension by putting unstable scale degrees on beat 1 of several measures (see measures 1, 2, 5, 6, 7). This tension however never gets out of hand, because in each case, it is resolved by the following note. For example, in measure 1, scale degree 2 is unstable in the <i>I</i> chord, but resolves to the stable scale degree 3. In measure 7, scale degree 7 is unstable in the <i>vi</i> chord, but resolves to the stable scale degree 1.</p> <p>Generally, when an unstable scale degree appears on a strong beat (beats 1 or 3 in a four-beat measure, or beats 1 or 4 in a six-beat measure) at some point the melodic line should resolve to the nearest stable scale degree (above or below). This technique of creating tension and resolution is a standard and effective technique for building interesting melodic lines. The key is not to let the tension build up too much (as in Melody B from before), otherwise your melody may be too unstable to resolve.</p> <p>Let’s take a look at another example in “Mr. Brightside” by The Killers. At this point, we will remove the stable scale degree highlights on the staff. We challenge you to continue to think on your own about every melody in terms of whether the notes are stable or unstable in the accompanying harmony.</p> <h4>“Mr. Brightside” by The Killers</h4> <theorytab video-path=3/3/08-Killers tab-id=189067 url-vars></theorytab> <p>Here the melody also makes use of unstable scale degrees on strong beats. For example, scale degree 4 on the first beat of the <i>I</i> chord and scale degree 2 on the first beat of the <i>vi</i> chord are both unstable notes on strong beats that resolve to their stable neighbors.</p> <div class=\"message info\" ng-if=flashEnabled> <p>Tip: you can hover your mouse over any chord to see its stable scale degrees.</p> </div> <div class=\"list card\"> <div class=\"item item-divider\"> Check For Understanding </div> <div class=\"item item-text-wrap\"> <p>In the following section of “Breakaway” by Kelly Clarkson, there are two unstable scale degrees that occur on weak beats, and two that occur on strong beats.

$templateCache.put("templates/book/3.4.html","<p>So far you’ve learned how individual notes affect a melody based on where they lie in a measure and how they relate to the underlying chords. However, perhaps one of the most challenging parts of writing a melody is linking the individual notes together in a way that both expresses what you want, but moreover, does so in a musically coherent and appealing way. In this section we’ll discuss a few ways to achieve this in your melodies.</p> <p>An important principle to keep in mind when writing melodies is that people like to hear a combination of both the old and the new. To strike this balance, it’s important to develop and repeat melodic themes and introduce variations on melodic patterns. If your melody never repeated material, there would be no sense of familiarity or satisfaction from predicting tensions and resolutions and the song would sound random. A pleasing melody will set up some predictable patterns, intermittently introducing more interesting and new patterns, and then surprise us by breaking patterns at key points in the song. Most people have pretty good intuition for this. When a song repeats the same thing over, and over again, we get bored. Conversely, songs that lack patterns don’t use enough familiar repeating elements to create a memorable sound. These songs lack the “hook” that causes the melody to get stuck in our heads. There are several easy ways to incorporate themes and patterns in your melodies to create a pleasing sound.</p> <p>One way to start forming a coherent and cohesive melody is to establish some rhythmic consistency. Repeating rhythms contained in your melody can be used establish a theme to be reprised. Consider the chorus of “Umbrella” by Rihanna:</p> <h4>“Umbrella” by Rihanna</h4> <theorytab video-path=3/4/1-Rihanna tab-id=189068 url-vars></theorytab> <div style=text-align:center;> Lyrics<br> <i>When the sun shines, we’ll shine together<br>Told you I’ll be here forever<br>Said I’ll always be your friend<br>Took an oath imma stick it out to the end</i> </div> <p>In this song, the harmony changes slowly enough that rhythmic themes are repeated over each chord. If you look carefully, you should be able to see that the rhythm of the notes and lyrics over the first three chords are exactly the same even though different notes are being sung with different lyrics. The rhythm over the last chord breaks the pattern and provides a nice contrast with the repetition that occurs immediately before it. This technique is often applied less strictly than in this example. Often songs will start with a rhythmic idea and then vary it, making slight changes to fit the lyrics better while keeping the general pattern in place. Umbrella happens to follow an A A A B grouping, but other rhythmic patterns are possible, and the length of the pattern need not last for only one chord. In “Bad Romance” by Lady Gaga, the rhythmic patterns are each two measures in length, and the pattern loosely follows an A B A B grouping.</p> <h4>“Bad Romance” by Lady Gaga</h4> <theorytab video-path=3/4/2-Gaga tab-id=4560 url-vars></theorytab> <p>In the next section we’ll show how songs expand on the idea of repeating rhythmic themes to include the notes as well.</p> ");
$templateCache.put("templates/book/3.5.html","<p>The principle of rhythmic consistency pertains to rhythmic ideas, but many songs also choose to integrate patterns into the choice of scale degrees that make up the melody.</p> <h3>Repetition</h3> <p>The simplest technique for integrating melodic themes is simply repeating the notes in the melody from phrase to phrase. The following diagram illustrates what repetition looks like:</p> <h4>Melodic theme: repetition</h4> <img src=img/Melody-Melodic-Themes-Repetition.jpg> ￼ <p>An example of a song that uses repetition is “You’re Beautiful” by James Blunt:</p> <h4>“You’re Beautiful” by James Blunt</h4> <theorytab video-path=3/5/1-Blunt tab-id=3267 url-vars></theorytab> <p>Another example of a song that uses repetition is “She Will Be Loved” by Maroon 5:</p> <h4>“She Will Be Loved” by Maroon 5</h4> <theorytab video-path=3/5/2-Maroon tab-id=5165 url-vars></theorytab> <p>Using repetition successfully requires careful planning (or blind luck) because a repeating melody that has not been chosen with care can clash with the underlying harmony, since scale degrees that are stable over one chord are not necessarily stable over another. Songwriters often have to break some of the rules regarding stable and unstable scale degrees in order to make use of repetition. This is where breaking the rules (with artistic license!) allows for more musical creativity and inventiveness.</p> <p>It turns out some rules are easier to bend than others. Certain chords, for example, are more forgiving than others when it comes to playing unstable scale degrees on strong beats that are not resolved. An unstable scale degree might sound fine over one chord, while sounding dissonant over another. <i>IV</i> chords, for instance, tend to be more accommodating of unstable scale degrees than <i>iii</i> chords (you’ll learn more about <i>iii</i> chords in the next chapter).</p> <h4><i>IV</i> with unstable scale degree 5 vs. <i>iii</i> with unstable scale degree 4</h4> <theorytab video-path=3.5-Unstable-Picky tab-id=260942 url-vars></theorytab> <p> Your ear is your best guide, but we’ve devised a mnemonic that will help you discern which chords are the most accommodating of unstable scale degrees. Just remember the simple rule that chords that have more “E”’s in their name (thrEE, onE, fivE) are more pickEE when it comes to fitting scale degrees in an overlying melody!</p> <p><img src=img/Melody-Chord-Flexibility.png></p> ￼ <h3>Modified Repetition</h3> <p>Sometimes songwriters will want to use repetition in their melody but won’t be able to without some egregious rule-breaking. For example, a repeating pattern might sound great over one chord, but not work at all when repeated over the next chord in the progression due to unresolved unstable scale degrees on strong beats. A common technique to deal with this problem involves making small changes to the offending scale degrees so that they fit with the underlying harmony. The result is a melody whose theme basically repeats, but with small variations. This technique is called modified repetition. Compared to (plain) repetition it looks like this:</p> <h4>Melodic theme: modified repetition</h4> <img src=img/Melody-Melodic-Themes-Modified-Repetition.jpg> ￼ <p>An example of a song that uses modified repetition is “Somebody Told Me” by The Killers:</p> <h4>“Somebody Told Me” by The Killers</h4> <theorytab video-path=3/5/3-Killers tab-id=3265 url-vars></theorytab> <p>Notice the pattern in measure 1 of the scale degrees: 1-1-1-1-6. This pattern repeats again in measure 2, but in measure 3, the final scale degree 6 would clash with the <i>V</i> chord. Thus the pattern is modified to: 1-1-1-1-7.</p> <h3>Sequence</h3> <p>Another common melodic theme is to shift the basic melodic phrase up or down so that it starts on a scale degree more appropriate for the underlying harmony. This is known as sequence and looks like this:</p> <h4>Melodic theme: sequence</h4> <img src=img/Melody-Melodic-Themes-Sequence.jpg> ￼ <p>Often the amount of shifting between phrases is kept the same. In other words, if the second phrase is shifted one scale degree down from the first phrase, the third idea will also be shifted one scale degree from the second phrase. An example of a song that uses a sequence is “Friends Forever” by Vitamin C. In this case, the same melodic pattern is repeated three times with each phrase starting two scale degrees below the previous one.</p> <h4>“Friends Forever” by Vitamin C</h4> <theorytab video-path=3/5/4-Vitamin tab-id=2952 url-vars></theorytab> <h3>Summary</h3> <p>The three common melodic patterns discussed in this section are summarized in the following figure. These patterns are examples to be studied, not a complete set that must be selected from when writing a melody:</p> <h4>Repetition</h4> <img src=img/Melody-Melodic-Themes-Repetition.jpg><br><br> <h4>Modified Repetition</h4> <img src=img/Melody-Melodic-Themes-Modified-Repetition.jpg><br><br> <h4>Sequence</h4> <img src=img/Melody-Melodic-Themes-Sequence.jpg> <p>When writing your melodies, remember that the human mind is as eager to recognize patterns as it is to look for new ones. Our ears are trained to like what is familiar to us - what we grew up listening to, what we like, what we find interesting. But our minds also crave the original, the novel, and the surprising. If you keep this in mind not just when writing melodies, but in the other aspects of your song as well, you’ll be on your way to writing something great.</p> ");

$templateCache.put("templates/book/4.1.html","<p>The first new chord we will talk about is the <i>iii</i> chord. <i>iii</i> has a sound that feels further away from home base compared to the other basic chords we’ve studied and isn’t used as often. <i>iii</i> also doesn’t have the flexibility of the chords we have learned so far; you will need to use it with care. This is especially true in songs with shorter chord progressions. We will see that the <i>iii</i> has significantly more utility in songs that use longer progressions where there is more time to play around harmonically.</p> <p>First, let’s listen to an example of a song that uses <i>iii</i> so you can hear how it sounds.</p> <h4>“Because of You” by Kelly Clarkson</h4> <theorytab video-path=4/1/1-Clarkson tab-id=4509 url-vars></theorytab> <p><i>iii</i> is less common than the other basic chords so when it appears directly after a <i>I</i> chord like this, it definitely gets the listener’s attention. </p> <p>Here are two common ways that the <i>iii</i> chord is used in a four-chord progression. </p> <h4>“If We Hold On Together” by Diana Ross</h4> <theorytab video-path=4/1/2-Ross tab-id=189065 url-vars></theorytab> <h4>“So What” by P!nk</h4> <theorytab video-path=4/1/3-Pink tab-id=4510 url-vars></theorytab> <p>Notice that in “If We Hold On Together” by Diana Ross, the progression goes <i>I</i> &rarr; <i>iii</i> &rarr; <i>IV</i>, and in “So What” by P!nk, the progression goes <i>I</i> &rarr; <i>iii</i> &rarr; <i>vi</i>. In general, when you use a <i>iii</i> chord, it should nearly always be followed with a <i>IV</i> or a <i>vi</i>. It is uncommon to follow the <i>iii</i> with any other chord.</p> <p>To illustrate this point, we’ve examined every song in our TheoryTab library and looked at what chord came after a <i>iii</i> whenever it occurred. The data reinforces the idea that either <i>IV</i> or <i>vi</i> follow the <i>iii</i> in most cases in real songs.</p> <h4>Chords that come after <i>iii</i></h4>  <img src=img/Harmony-II-iii-Chord-Relative-Frequency.svg> <p>In practical terms, this means that there isn’t much room for harmonic creativity when using the <i>iii</i> chord in songs with short repeating chord progressions. The reason for this is that a four-chord progression starting on <i>I</i> has only two chords before it cadences with a <i>IV</i> or a <i>V</i> (<i>iii</i> is not a cadence chord and does not usually work well at the end of a progression). Since the <i>iii</i> needs to be followed by a <i>IV</i> or a <i>vi</i>, the progression essentially must look like: <i>I</i> &rarr; <i>iii</i> &rarr; (<i>IV</i> or <i>vi</i>) &rarr; (<i>V</i> or <i>IV</i>). This constraint is rather limiting, however it’s worth mentioning that tons of Billboard hits use chord progressions of this form with great success. “Because of You” by Kelly Clarkson (above) is a good example. “The One That Got Away” by Katy Perry (<i>I</i> &rarr; <i>iii</i> &rarr; <i>vi</i> &rarr; <i>IV</i>) is another, shown below.</p> <h4>“The One That Got Away” by Katy Perry</h4> <theorytab video-path=4/1/4.1-Katy-Perry-The-One-That-Got-Away tab-id=260924 url-vars></theorytab> <p>In songs with longer chord progressions, <i>iii</i> has more flexibility. <i>vi</i> or <i>IV</i> will still come after the <i>iii</i>, but you can also take your time both getting to the <i>iii</i> and maneuvering toward your cadence. The verse of “Night Minds” by Missy Higgins gives a good example of a <i>iii</i> used in a longer progression.</p> <h4>“Night Minds” by Missy Higgins</h4> <theorytab video-path=4/1/4-Higgins tab-id=4511 url-vars></theorytab> <p>The first half of this example uses a standard <i>I</i> &rarr; <i>V</i> &rarr; <i>IV</i>, but the second half uses <i>iii</i> to change the pattern of the progression. After <i>iii</i> goes to <i>IV</i> the first time, we expect the progression to end with a <i>V</i>. Instead the song prolongs the progression by going back to the <i>iii</i> again before building to the strong <i>IV</i> &rarr; <i>V</i> to end the progression. Part of the reason that the final <i>V</i> sounds so nice here is that the songwriter has built up anticipation for it. Now that you know more chords, it’s easier incorporate tricks like this into a larger more interesting progression.</p> <div class=\"list card\"> <div class=\"item item-divider\"> Review </div> <div class=\"item item-text-wrap\"> <p>What chord makes the most sense in this context?</p> <img src=img/Harmony-II-Chord-Context.png> <ol type=a> <li><i>IV</i></li> <li><i>V</i></li> <li><i>vi</i></li> <li><i>I</i></li> </ol> <button class=\"button button-block button-positive button-outline\" ng-click=\"show1 = !show1\"> Show Answer </button> <div ng-if=\"show1 == true\"> <p><i>IV</i> doesn’t work because scale degree 2 and 3 are unstable over <i>IV</i>. <i>V</i>, <i>vi</i>, and <i>I</i> are all harmonically compatible with the melody (no unresolved unstable scale degrees on strong beats); however <i>I</i> and <i>V</i> are generally used at the beginning and end of a progression and not as an expansion of <i>iii</i> so <i>vi</i> makes the most sense.</p> <theorytab video-path=4/1/5-Ex-Context tab-id=5164 url-vars></theorytab> </div> </div> </div> <p>Another common function of <i>iii</i> is to link <i>IV</i> and <i>vi</i> as is done in “Basketcase” by Green Day</p> <h4>“Basketcase” by Green Day</h4> <theorytab video-path=4/1/6-Green-Day tab-id=4512 url-vars></theorytab> <p>You may recognize this progression as the progression of the famous classical piece, “Canon in D” by Pachelbel, which has been used countless times in many genres of popular music: </p> <h4>“Canon In D” by Pachelbel</h4> <theorytab video-path=4/1/7-Pachebel tab-id=4513 url-vars></theorytab> <div class=\"list card\"> <div class=\"item item-divider\"> Review </div> <div class=\"item item-text-wrap\"> <p>In which of the following places below would a <i>iii</i> chord be appropriate?</p> <img src=img/Harmony-II-Where-Is-iii-Appropriate.png> <ol type=a> <li>A only</li> <li>B only</li> <li>C only</li> <li>A and B</li> <li>A and C</li> <li>A, B, and C</li> </ol> <button class=\"button button-block button-positive button-outline\" ng-click=\"show2 = !show2\"> Show Answer </button> <div ng-if=\"show2 == true\"> <p>d.

$templateCache.put("templates/book/4.2.html","<p>Like the <i>iii</i> chord, the <i>ii</i> chord is slightly more harmonically distant than <i>IV</i>, <i>V</i>, and <i>vi</i>. However, unlike the <i>iii</i>, the <i>ii</i> does not have the same restrictions as to which chords should follow it. In fact, the <i>ii</i> is extremely versatile and can be used in a number of different situations. To illustrate this, we’ve made a similar chart to the one in the last section, this time showing the statistics for which chords follow a <i>ii</i> chord in the Theorytab database.</p> <h4>Chords That Come After <i>ii</i></h4>  <img src=img/Harmony-II-ii-Chord-Relative-Frequency.svg> <p>One function of <i>ii</i> is as a substitution for a <i>IV</i>. One famous example of this substitution occurred in the so-called “50’s progression”. During the 1950’s, the progression <i>I</i> &rarr; <i>vi</i> &rarr; <i>IV</i> &rarr; <i>V</i> showed up in so many hit songs that people began to take notice. The progression was even lampooned in the musical <i>Grease</i> in the song “Those Magic Changes”</p> <h4>“Those Magic Changes” by Sha Na Na</h4> <theorytab video-path=4/2/1-Magic tab-id=4524 url-vars></theorytab> <p>Clearly innovation was needed, and songwriters looking for a “fresh” sound struck upon the idea to use the same progression while simply replacing the <i>IV</i> with the slightly more exotic sounding <i>ii</i> chord. The result was a slew of songs using the much more original <i>I</i> &rarr; <i>vi</i> &rarr; <i>ii</i> &rarr; <i>V</i>. “Sherry” by The Four Seasons is one of many examples from the era:</p> <h4>“Sherry” by The Four Seasons</h4> <theorytab video-path=4/2/2-Sherry tab-id=4514 url-vars></theorytab> <p>The reason <i>ii</i> can often substitute for <i>IV</i> so nicely is that both chords can function as what are called <b>pre-cadence chords</b>. In the Harmony-I chapter, we talked about the basic structure that most chord progressions follow. After leaving home base, the progression plays around harmonically before getting back to <i>I</i> through a cadence chord:</p> <h4>Simple Chord Progression</h4> <img src=img/Harmony-I-Cadence.png> <p>In a longer progression, pre-cadence chords smooth the transition to the cadence chord (remember, <i>V</i> is the most common cadence chord in a long progression). Below we show where a pre-cadence chord goes in a general progression:</p> <h4>Simple Chord Progression With a Pre-Cadence Chord</h4> <img src=img/Harmony-I-Cadence-With-PC.jpg> <p>Along with <i>IV</i>, <i>ii</i> is the most common pre-cadence chord. However, to say that <i>ii</i> is just a substitute for <i>IV</i> in all circumstances is an oversimplification. In shorter progressions, you learned that <i>IV</i> frequently can act as a cadence chord just like <i>V</i>. <i>ii</i>, on the other hand, does not have a strong pull towards <i>I</i>, so it is not normally used to end a chord progression. When <i>IV</i> is acting as a cadence chord, <i>ii</i> is not a good replacement for <i>IV</i>.</p> <p>In addition to its role as a pre-cadence chord, <i>ii</i> also functions well before or after the <i>IV</i> chord itself.

Since the <i>ii</i> is a good pre-cadence chord, it can act as the third chord of the progression: <i>I</i> &rarr; <i>X</i> &rarr; <i>ii</i> &rarr; (<i>IV</i> or <i>V</i>), where <i>X</i> can be a number of chords such as <i>IV</i>, <i>vi</i>, or <i>V</i>.

A common choice for this chord is the <i>vi</i>, which serves nicely to set up a cadence on <i>V</i> or <i>IV</i>, as in “Halo” by Beyonce:</p> <h4>“Halo” by Beyonce</h4> <theorytab video-path=4/2/4-Beyonce tab-id=4516 url-vars></theorytab> <p>In the next chapter we will be introducing you to chord inversions.

Inversions will give you access to a whole new harmonic toolset that allows more flexibility and creativity in your songwriting.</p> ");
$templateCache.put("templates/book/5.1.html","<p>Every chord you’ve learned so far has contained exactly three unique notes (scale degrees). In the introduction chapter we learned that, while there are many ways to arrange these notes to create a chord, under normal circumstances the bottom or root scale degree is always the same (a <i>I</i> chord uses scale degree 1 on the bottom, <i>ii</i> uses scale degree 2, etc.)</p> <p>Inverted chords do away with this last stipulation and allow the bottom note to be any of notes that make up the chord. When the lowest note or <b>bass</b> note is not the root of the chord, we say that the chord is in an <b>inversion</b>. The basic chords have three notes so there are three possibilities for the bass. When the bass of the chord is just the normal root of the chord (scale degree 1 of a <i>I</i> chord, scale degree 5 of a <i>V</i> chord etc.), we say that the chord is in <b>root position</b>. If instead the next note that makes up the chord is in the bass, the chord is said to be in <b>first inversion</b>. A <i>I</i> chord (which is made up of scale degrees 1, 3, and 5) in first inversion would have scale degree 3 in the bass. When the third note that makes up a chord is in the bass, we say that the chord is in <b>second inversion</b>. In a <i>I</i> chord, this would occur when it is played with scale degree 5 in the bass.</p> <p>To label whether a chord is in an inversion or not, we follow the convention used by classical musicians. When a chord is in first inversion, a superscript <sup>“6”</sup> is placed next to the chord (i.e. <i>I<sup>6</sup></i>). Second inversion chords are labeled with the numbers “<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub>” next to them (i.e. <i>I<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub></i>). The (optional) discussion at the end of this section describes where these naming conventions come from.</p> <p>The next example shows scale degrees 1, 3, and 5 of a <i>I</i> chord arranged with a different note on the bottom to create each inversion of <i>I</i> (the superscripts and subscripts on the chords will be explained shortly).</p> <h4>Inversions of <i>I</i></h4> <theorytab video-path=5/1/1-I-Inversions-Expanded tab-id=5182 url-vars=\"bShowSupportNameGraphicRel=true\"></theorytab> <p>You may have noticed that inverting the chord also changed the color of the chord block. This is a visual indicator that the bass note has changed, for instance to scale degree 3 (first inversion) and scale degree 5 (second inversion) for the <i>I</i> chord.</p> <p>We have also shown the inversions of a C major chord in the above example below the Roman numerals to give a concrete example of a real chord and its inversions. a C major chord (made up of the notes C, E, and G) is in root position if the lowest note being played is a C. It’s in first inversion if the lowest note being played is an E and is labeled <i>C/E</i> (read “<i>C</i> over E”). It’s in second inversion if the lowest note being played is a G and is labeled <i>C/G</i> (read “<i>C</i> over G”).</p> <h3>Inversion Naming Conventions</h3> <p>The following diagram has been annotated to show the intervals between the notes in each inversion and shows the longhand and shorthand names of each inversion.</p> <h4>Inversion Naming Conventions</h4> <img src=img/inversions-of-I-markup.jpg> <p>To motivate the naming convention for inversions, consider the first inversion <i><i>I<sup>6</sup></i></i> chord in the figure above. Scale degree 3 is in the bass, and if we count up from that we see that the next note, scale degree 5, is three scale degrees above (count 3, 4, 5). Similarly, the other note in the chord is scale degree 1 which is the sixth scale degree above the bass (count 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1). Thus, the label <sup>6</sup><sub>3</sub> is used to indicate the three-scale-degree and six-scale-degree intervals that occur when a chord is in its first inversion. Likewise, the <sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub> next to the <i>I</i> represents the four-scale-degree and six-scale-degree intervals that occur when a chord is in its second inversion.</p> <p>The short hand abbreviation is preferred by classically trained musicians, so that is what we will use throughout this book. The take-away is the super script and subscripts represent the interval spacing of the scale degrees that make up the chord. In practice it’s probably easier to just memorize a “<sup>6</sup>” chord is a first inversion chord, and a “<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub>” chord is a second inversion chord.</p> ");
$templateCache.put("templates/book/5.2.html","<p>While every chord can be inverted, not all are commonly found in popular music. For now we will be focusing on the most commonly used inversions, and we’ll start with the <i>I<sup>6</sup></i> (read “one six”, the first inversion of <i>I</i>).</p> <p>When a chord is played in an inversion it has a different sound than its root position counterpart even though all notes that make up the chord are the same. This may seem unintuitive, but the bass note turns out to be very important to our ears. First inversion chords are often described as having a softer feel. The <i>I<sup>6</sup></i>, for example, doesn’t feel nearly as stable as a conventional home base <i>I</i> chord does. The following is an example of a song which uses both a <i>I</i> chord and a <i>I<sup>6</sup></i> chord in the same progression.</p> <h4>“The Heart of Life” by John Mayer</h4> <theorytab video-path=5-2017-02-18-crf23-r100/5.2-Mayer tab-id=4517 url-vars></theorytab> <p>Can you hear the difference between the two uses? Because inverted chords sound different, they are useful for breaking the monotony of using all root position chords. Let’s listen to another common use of the <i>I<sup>6</sup></i> chord.</p> <h4>“The Road And The Radio” by Kenny Chesney</h4> <theorytab video-path=5-2017-02-18-crf23-r100/5.2-Chesney tab-id=4593 url-vars></theorytab> <p>Even though <i>I</i> and <i>I<sup>6</sup></i> have the same notes, moving to the first inversion from the root position <i>I</i> chord provides an interesting if subtle departure from home base. In the actual recording of “The Road and the Radio” by Kenny Chesney, the departure is made even stronger by the extra strong emphasis that the bass note receives in the actual recording. The strength of the bass note acts almost as a second melody, easily hummable by the listener. This is contrasted with the more subtle use of the <i>I<sup>6</sup></i> in “Heart Of Life” by John Mayer.</p> <p><i>I<sup>6</sup></i> goes to the <i>IV</i> chord in both of the above examples, and this is quite typical. The <i>I<sup>6</sup></i> has scale degree 3 in the bass which has a nice sounding stepwise motion to the neighboring scale degree 4 in the root of the <i>IV</i> chord. Another common use of the <i>I<sup>6</sup></i> takes this stepwise motion one step further and uses it to link <i>ii</i> and <i>IV</i>. Consider the following example:</p> <h4>“All American Girl” by Carrie Underwood</h4> <theorytab video-path=5-2017-02-18-crf23-r100/5.2-Underwood tab-id=4519 url-vars></theorytab> <p>The <i>I<sup>6</sup></i> is used as an effective bridge between <i>ii</i> and <i>IV</i>. By using <i>I<sup>6</sup></i>, the bass is able to ascend and descend in a continuous fashion with no jumps in scale degrees. While not as strong as the melody itself, the bass often plays important melodic roles in songs. While you don’t have nearly as much flexibility with the bass as you do the melody, a clever songwriter will often use his/her harmonic knowledge to compose an interesting progression that creates a melodic bass line.</p> ");
$templateCache.put("templates/book/5.3.html","<p><i>V<sup>6</sup></i> (read “five six”, the first inversion of <i>V</i>) is also a commonly used inverted chord in popular music. By using an inversion of <i>V</i>, the usual strong tendency to go back to <i>I</i> is significantly reduced. <i>V<sup>6</sup></i> can precede a <i>I</i> chord but this would usually be in the middle of a progression where it is not desired to have a “cadence” feel to it. One very common use of <i>V<sup>6</sup></i> is to directly expand from <i>I</i>. Listen to “You Look Wonderful Tonight” by Eric Clapton for an example of this usage:</p> <h4>“You Look Wonderful Tonight” by Eric Clapton</h4> <theorytab video-path=5-2017-02-18-crf23-r100/5.3-Clapton tab-id=4520 url-vars></theorytab> <p>It is also typical to follow the <i>V<sup>6</sup></i> with a <i>vi</i> chord. In the same way that <i>I<sup>6</sup></i> serves as a bridge between <i>ii</i> and <i>IV</i>, <i>V<sup>6</sup></i> can serve as a bridge between <i>I</i> and <i>vi</i>. For an example of how this sounds, listen to “Can You Feel The Love Tonight” by Elton John.</p> <h4>“Can You Feel The Love Tonight” by Elton John</h4> <theorytab video-path=5-2017-02-18-crf23-r100/5.3-John tab-id=4521 url-vars></theorytab> <p>This song uses the common <i>I</i> &rarr; <i>V</i> &rarr; <i>vi</i> &rarr; <i>IV</i> progression, but the <i>V<sup>6</sup></i> gives a more subtle feel to the <i>V</i>. “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing” by Aerosmith also starts with this same progression, but instead of using the <i>IV</i> as a cadence to <i>I</i>, they go to <i>I<sup>6</sup></i> instead.</p> <h4>“I Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” by Aerosmith</h4> <theorytab video-path=5-2017-02-18-crf23-r100/5.3-Aerosmith tab-id=4522 url-vars></theorytab> <p>Because the <i>I</i> is played in an inversion, the progression doesn’t feel like it’s over.

$templateCache.put("templates/book/5.4.html","<p>The <i>I</i> chord is also commonly heard in second inversion. Second inversion chords are abbreviated <sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub>. In the key of C, a second inversion <i>I</i> chord, or <i>I<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub></i> (read “one six four”), is just a C major chord with a G played in the bass. So far, the inverted chords we’ve studied have functioned much like their root position equivalents. However, this is often not the case for the <i>I<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub></i>. One of the most important uses of <i>I<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub></i> is immediately before a strong cadential <i>V</i> chord. The combination of a <i>I<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub></i> and <i>V</i> creates a strong cadential effect. This is so common in music that it has been given a special name - the “cadential <i>I<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub></i>”. An example of a song that uses the cadential <i>I<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub></i> is below:</p> <h4>“I Do It For You” by Bryan Adams</h4> <theorytab video-path=5/4/1-Adams tab-id=5184 url-vars></theorytab> <p><i>I<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub></i> and <i>V</i> have such a strong cadential feel together that they shouldn’t be repeated over and over again in a short progression. In fact, one of the most typical uses of <i>I<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub></i> &rarr; <i>V</i> is to end a song. Typically the <i>V</i> would cadence directly to a strong final <i>I</i> chord. Here is an example of a song that uses the cadential <i>I<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub></i> to end the song:</p> <h4>“Circle of Life” from the motion picture <i>The Lion King</i></h4> <theorytab video-path=5/4/2-Lion-King tab-id=4526 url-vars></theorytab> <p>Notice that “Circle of Life” doesn’t actually go directly to the <i>I</i> from <i>V</i> because an extra <i>IV</i> chord has been inserted to prolong the progression for a full measure. When our ears hear <i>I<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub></i> &rarr; <i>V</i>, they really expect to hear a <i>I</i>. Creating a sense of anticipation for a particular chord and then going to a different one instead creates what is known as a “deceptive cadence.” Although we will not cover in detail the theory behind deceptive cadences here, using deception is yet another way in which you as the songwriter can create tension and resolution in your chord progressions.</p> <p>While using <i>I<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub></i> as a pre-cadence to <i>V</i> is the most common use of <i>I<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub></i>, it does have other uses as well. As with the other inversions we’ve learned, it is typical to use the scale degree in the bass to link neighboring chords (in this case the chords <i>IV</i> and <i>vi</i>). Here is an example of a song that uses this technique along with other inverted chords to create a descending bass line. </p> <h4>“Let Your Hair Down” by MAGIC</h4> <theorytab video-path=5.4-MAGIC-Let-Your-Hair-Down tab-id=260939 url-vars=\"bForceVoice1=true\"></theorytab> <div class=\"list card\"> <div class=\"item item-divider\"> Review </div> <div class=\"item item-text-wrap\"> <p><i>I<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub></i> has what scale degree in the bass?</p> <ol type=a> <li>1</li> <li>2</li> <li>3</li> <li>4</li> <li>5</li> </ol> <button class=\"button button-block button-positive button-outline\" ng-click=\"show1 = !show1\"> Show Answer </button> <div ng-if=\"show1 == true\" class=\"content message info\"> e </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"list card\"> <div class=\"item item-divider\"> Review </div> <div class=\"item item-text-wrap\"> <p>The most common use of the <i>I<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub></i> is to strongly end a chord progression (often to end a song).

$templateCache.put("templates/book/_5.5.html","<p>With chord inversions, we saw that the choice of what note to play in the bass can have a large effect on the feel of a song. Inverted chords use scale degrees that are part of the chord being played, but in certain circumstances even this can be ignored. In pedal harmony, the bass note is repeated on a fixed scale degree while the chords are changing above it.</p> <p>Usually songs that use pedal harmony repeat scale degree 1. This keeps the song closer to home bass, and in doing so, diminishes the power of the chord progression being played. This can be extremely effective when you want to build momentum gradually and wish to avoid going too big too early. One song that uses pedal harmony in this way is the intro to “Everything I Do” by Bryan Adams:</p> <h4>“I Do It For You” by Bryan Adams</h4> <theorytab video-path=5/5/1-Adams-Pedal tab-id=4525 url-vars></theorytab> <p>In this example, the second chord of the progression is a <i>V</i> chord, but there is a scale degree 1 in the bass instead of the typical 5. To indicate this difference, the chord is written as “<i>V/1</i>” (read as “five over one”) and colored red (the color of scale degree 1). This same pedal 1 is used by the first 4 chords in the progression. These chords (<i>I</i> &rarr; <i>V</i> &rarr; <i>IV</i> &rarr; <i>V</i>) normally create a strong progression, but by using a pedal 1, the song never feels like it completely leaves home base. The second repetition of this same progression adds energy by finally letting go of the pedal on the <i>IV</i> chord to allow the progression to fully depart from home base. Adams also splits the <i>V</i> chord and slots in a cadential 6-4 (<i>I<sup>6</sup><sub>4</sub></i>) chord. The more powerful cadential 6-4 and the accompanying change in harmonic rhythm all add together to create the nice buildup. An important practical note: when a chord is played with a pedal note, the pedal does not replace the original bass note, it is played in addition to it. In other words, a <i>V/1</i> still needs to have scale degree 5 in it.</p> <p>The characteristic repetition of the note in the bass can also be used to create a droning hypnotic groove desirable in certain genres of music. One example of a song that uses pedal tones for this is the beginning of “Eye of the Tiger” by Survivor. A drone is created by a quickly repeated scale degree 6 while the chords change above it. Usually songs that use pedal harmony repeat scale degree 1 because it emphasizes the key that the song is written in. However that’s not the case here. In the next volume of this series, we will learn about songs that treat the <i>vi</i> as a home base instead. In these cases, scale degree 6 is commonly used as the pedal tone. Just as in “I Do It For You”, “Eye of the Tiger” let’s go of the pedal in the second verse to increase the intensity of the progression.</p> <h4>“Eye of The Tiger” by Survivor</h4> <theorytab video-path=5/5/2-Survivor tab-id=4525 url-vars></theorytab>");

How can I get from this chord to that chord? How can I create a great sounding melody? </p> <p>Hooktheory I has already answered these questions and others like them for thousands of guitarists, pianists, singers, DJs, producers, and students all over the world.</p> <p>The concepts are applicable to all types of music, but examples are drawn from popular songs you’ve probably heard on the radio. Lastly, because the explanations are drawn from our TheoryTab format, even people that don’t read conventional sheet music can benefit from the concepts we cover. </p> <h2>Integrated With Other Parts of the Hooktheory Ecosystem</h2>  <p>Hooktheory I was written from the ground up to be used alongside our free Hookpad music editing software. Hookpad simplifies songwriting by helping you choose chords that sound good together and guiding you to write a good melody. It’s musical sketchpad with music theory \"built-in\" to make it easier and more intuitive to find the sound you’re looking for. <a href=http://www.hooktheory.com/editor/about>Learn more about Hookpad.</a></p> <h2>About the Authors</h2>  <p>Hey there.
